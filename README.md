#  README: Algorithm Implementation and Analysis

## 1. Project Overview

This project (**AlgorithmsAssignment**) is an implementation and comparative analysis of four key algorithms from the field of Computer Science. The goal is to empirically measure the execution time, number of operations, maximum recursion depth, and memory usage.

- **Language**: Java 17
- **Build System**: Apache Maven
- **Testing**: JUnit 5
- **Output**: Generates a `measurements.csv` file for detailed analysis.

## 2. Project Structure

The project is organized following Maven standards, with necessary directories for source code and unit tests:

- **pom.xml**: Maven configuration file. It defines dependencies (JUnit 5) and plugins.
- **src/main/java/mypackage/**: Main code directory. Contains the algorithm classes (`MergeSort`, `QuickSort`, `Select`, `ClosestPair`), `Metrics`, and `App`.
- **Tests/**: Unit tests. Contains tests for verifying the correctness of all algorithms (JUnit 5 is used).
- **App.java**: Main class. The entry point for running the benchmarks and generating the CSV file.
- **measurements.csv**: Results file. Generated by `App.java`, containing all metrics.

## 3. Algorithm Details

### 1. **Merge Sort** (`MergeSort.java`)
- **Complexity**: O(N log N)
- **Requirement**: Uses **CUTOFF** (insertion sort) for small subarrays. The auxiliary buffer is allocated only once.

### 2. **Quick Sort** (`QuickSort.java`)
- **Complexity**: O(N log N) on average
- **Requirement**: Uses a randomized pivot. The recursion depth is limited to O(log N) (recursing on the smaller partition, iterating on the larger one), which prevents O(N²) memory usage in the worst case.

### 3. **K-th Element** (`Select.java`)
- **Complexity**: O(N) (worst-case)
- **Requirement**: Implements **Deterministic Select** (Median of Medians, MoM5). Guarantees linear time. Recursion is only performed on the needed side of the partition.

### 4. **Closest Pair of Points** (`ClosestPair.java`)
- **Complexity**: O(N log N)
- **Requirement**: **Divide and Conquer** algorithm. The "strip" check is limited to 7-8 neighbors, ensuring linear time during the merge phase.

## 4. Metrics and Analysis

The `Metrics` class collects key performance indicators, which are then written to the `measurements.csv` file.

### Measured Metrics:
- **Time_ns**: Execution time in nanoseconds.
- **Comparisons**: Total number of comparisons (primary measure of efficiency).
- **MaxDepth**: Maximum recursion depth.
- **Allocations**: Number of memory allocations (for MergeSort, this should be O(1)).

### Expected Analysis:
- **QuickSort (MaxDepth)**: Should be close to log N, confirming the effectiveness of the limited stack depth implementation.
- **Deterministic Select**: Time and comparisons should show strictly linear growth, O(N), confirming the theoretical guarantee of the algorithm.
- **MergeSort and ClosestPair**: Both should show O(N log N) for time and comparisons.

## 5. Running and Testing Instructions

To check and generate metrics, follow these steps:

1. **Maven Build**: Ensure all dependencies are downloaded. In IntelliJ IDEA, click **Reimport All Maven Projects** or use the command `mvn clean install`.
2. **Run Tests**: Run all classes in the **Tests** folder (Right-click → **Run 'All Tests'**) to verify the correctness of the algorithms.
3. **Generate Metrics**: Run the `main()` method in the `App.java` class. The `measurements.csv` file will be created in the root directory of the project.
